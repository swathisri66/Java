CORE JAVA
---------
Programming languages
1. HLL (High level languages) user understandable
   --> Procedure oriented languages
        ex: c, pascal, cobol, basic, fortran
   --> Object oriented languages
        ex: C++, java, python, C#, Ruby, R-lang, ABAP, GO

2. LLL (Low level languages) machine understandable
   --> Ada, Assembly, Binary Language

Java is a High level and Object oriented programming lang.

Java Features
-------------
1) Simple to learn (because it is a HLL)
2) Support to OOPs concepts  (classes & objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance,Abstraction, Polymorphysm)
3) Platform independent  (not ristricted to any operating system)
     source code can be compiled on one O/S and can be executed on another O/S
4) Robust language (automated: it has a large library of functions, classes, packages)
5) Multi-Threaded Language  
6) Exception handelling

History of java
- Originally java was called as Oak (developed Oak International Corporation)
- Later oak was taken over by Sun Micro Systems and software was renamed as Java
- But now java belongs to Oracle Corporation (oracle has taken over sun micro system)


Java Programming Language structure
-----------------------------------
Java has as set 58 keywords (now 54 keywords)

java notations:
--> UPPERCASE notation is used for Constant declarations
--> lowercase notation is used for keywords, package names
--> TitleCase notation is used for class names or interface names
       class StudentInformation 
--> camelCase notation is used for variables, functions  
       int studentRollNumber, marksObtained, averageMarks;
       long phoneNumber;
       void getEmpData()
       {
       }

structure of a java program
---------------------------

/* multiple line 
    comment (this can be for many lines also) */
// single line comment   (there is no ending symbol)
import packagename.ClassName;
      (OR)
import packagename.*;     (* symbol indicates all classes and interfaces of the package)
class <user defined ClassName>
{
   .............................
   .............................
   ...properties of the class...
      variables and functions
   .............................
   .............................
   public static void main(String args[])       // both ways are correct int x[] (OR) int[] x;
   {
      .............................
      .............................
        actual program content (main logic)
      .............................
      .............................
   }    // main closing
};      // end of the class     writing (;) is optional
