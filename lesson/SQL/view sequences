VIEWS
-----
A view is a representation for a 'select' query (not a table).
Such query can be any query (
   simple select query, 
   select query with a filter (where condition)
   select query with set operators (union, intersect,...)
   select query with sub query 
   select query with a join (any type, simple join , self, outer, cross)

such view name can be used instead of the whole query

CREATE VIEW <view_name> AS <select statement> ;

create view v1 as 
select * from emp2 
where 
employee_id between 105 and 125 and 
department_id in (30,50,80);

select * from v1;

Remember that v1 is not a table, it is only a representation of the query.
When we modiy the original table, view gets refreshed
When we access the view, the query that is internally represented will get executed
Therefore as of that time whatever data is available that will be displayed by the view.

create view emp_summary as
select department_id, count(*) as "count", sum(salary) as "sal_total", avg(salary) as "avg_sal", min(salary) as "leaset_sal", max(salary) as "highest_sal"
from emp2
where hire_date>'1-jan-05'
group by department_id
having count(*) > 5
order by department_id;

select * from emp_summary;

select department_id, highest_sal from emp_summary;    (this is an error)

select department_id, "highest_sal" from emp_summary;    (this is correct now)

select department_id, "highest_sal" from emp_summary where "highest_sal">10000;

select department_id, "highest_sal" from emp_summary where department_id>=60;

create view emp_data as
select e.employee_id, e.first_name, d.department_name, j.job_title
from employees e, departments d, jobs j
where e.department_id=d.department_id
and e.job_id = j.job_id;

select * from emp_data;

select * from emp_data where department_name='Finance';
------------------------------------------------------------------

Views can be granted to other users, so that the other users can see only that specific data.

HR>	grant select on emp_data to ramesh;
RAMESH>	select * from hr.emp_data;
RAMESH> create synonym x for hr.emp_data;
RAMESH> select * from x;

SELECT * FROM user_views;
SELECT view_name, text FROM user_views;
This table shows the information about the view and thier represented query.

DROP VIEW v1;
DROP VIEW emp_data;

SEQUENCES
---------
A sequence is series of values created at the database server, so that these values
can be used by us to intert them into the table
This will ensure that no values is skipped or repeated.
Also from the user side, the burden of remembering the next coming number can be avoided.

CREATE SEQUENCE <seqname> 
INCREMENT BY <value>
START WITH <value>
MAXVALUE <value>;

Once the sequence is created, we use that sequence by the pseudo columns 
CURRVAL, NEXTVAL

create sequence seq1 increment by 1 start with 111 ;

insert into emp3 values (seq1.nextval, 'Ramesh',10000, 1000, 'ac_mgr', '10-mar-20');

select seq1.currval from dual; 

select * from user_sequences;

drop sequence <sequence_name>;
drop sequence seq1;
